- **32 Expert Networks**: Specialized sub-systems for different pattern types
- **Meta-Learning**: The system improves its own learning algorithms

### 3. **200-Dimensional Strategy Evolution**

## 🌟 Key Features

### Beyond Human Pattern Recognition

```python
# The AI might discover:
"When the 7th Fourier harmonic of WETH/USDC oscillations 
aligns with the 11th harmonic of gas prices, while the 
topological genus of liquidity = 3, there's 87% chance 
of $127.50 profit in next 15 blocks"

# But explains it to humans as:
"When trading gets 'choppy' in a specific pattern and 
gas prices dance similarly, a hidden opportunity appears. 
Like ocean waves aligning to create a super-wave."
```

### Explainable Decisions

Every decision includes:
- **Executive Summary**: One-paragraph explanation for traders
- **Technical Details**: Step-by-step analysis for developers  
- **Mathematical Proof**: Formal verification of profitability
- **Visual Diagrams**: Interactive charts and pattern visualizations
- **Executable Code**: Ready-to-run implementation

### Knowledge Sharing

The system shares discoveries while maintaining competitive advantage:
- Publishes generalized patterns for community benefit
- Creates educational content from discoveries
- Maintains edge through execution speed and proprietary optimizations

population_size: 100          # Strategies to evolve
enable_meta_evolution: true   # Let system evolve its evolution

# Transparency settings
blockchain_trace: true        # Record decisions on-chain
explanation_detail: full      # Generate all explanation types
share_discoveries: true       # Share with community
```

### 3. Run Superhuman Mode

```bash
python main.py superhuman
```

## 📊 Example Output

### Pattern Discovery
```
[2024-01-15 10:23:45] Discovered 47-dimensional arbitrage pattern
Pattern involves: mempool clustering + cross-chain flows + gas fractals
Human translation: "When transactions cluster like schools of fish and 
multiple chains show similar ripples, arbitrage emerges"
Expected profit: $127.50 per occurrence
Frequency: 23 times per day
Confidence: 91.3%
```

### Human Explanation
```
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Decision decision_1705334625123456

**Decision**: EXECUTE arbitrage opportunity
**Confidence**: 94.2%
**Expected Profit**: $156.78
**Risk Level**: Low

**In Simple Terms**: The AI found that when WETH/USDC prices oscillate
in a specific 7-wave pattern while gas prices follow an 11-wave pattern,
and these patterns align (like tuning forks resonating), there's a 94%
chance of profitable arbitrage.

**Why Humans Miss This**: Tracking 47 variables simultaneously while
calculating Fourier transforms in real-time is beyond human capability.

**Action**: Buy WETH on Uniswap V3, sell on SushiSwap within 2 blocks.
