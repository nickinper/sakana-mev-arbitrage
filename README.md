No complex setup. No huge capital requirements. Just find opportunities, execute, and profit.

## Overview

This system uses evolutionary algorithms to discover profitable MEV arbitrage strategies without manual strategy design. The population of agents evolves through crossover and mutation, with natural selection based on actual profit performance.

## Key Features

- **Evolutionary Multi-Agent Architecture**: Population of specialized agents that evolve over generations
- **Collective Intelligence**: Multiple specialists vote on opportunities with reputation-weighted decisions
- **No Manual Strategy Design**: The system discovers profitable strategies through evolution
- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Continuously evolves with market conditions
- **Risk Distribution**: Multiple agents reduce single-point-of-failure

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository>
cd sakana-mev-arbitrage

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
# - Add Ethereum RPC URLs
# - Add API keys
# - Configure initial capital
```

### 2. Ingest Historical Data

```bash
# Ingest last 1000 blocks for training data
python main.py data --start-block 18500000 --end-block 18501000
```

### 3. Run Evolution

```bash
# Evolve strategies for 100 generations
python main.py evolution --generations 100
```

### 4. Backtest Best Strategies

```bash
# Test evolved strategies on historical data
python main.py backtest
```

### 5. Paper Trading

```bash
# Run live paper trading with best strategy
python main.py live
```

## Configuration

### Evolution Parameters (`config/evolution_params.yaml`)

- **Population Size**: 20 agents (focused approach)
- **Mutation Rate**: 5% (conservative)
- **Crossover Rate**: 80% (high mixing)
- **Elite Retention**: 20% (preserve best)

### Strategy Genes (`config/strategy_genes.yaml`)

Agents evolve these parameters:
- Token pairs to trade
- Minimum profit thresholds
- Gas price limits
- Slippage tolerance
- Execution timing
- Flash loan usage

### Risk Limits (`config/risk_limits.yaml`)

- Maximum 10% position size
- 5% daily loss limit
- Circuit breakers and emergency stops

## Operating Modes

### Data Mode
Ingests historical blockchain data to identify arbitrage opportunities for training.

### Evolution Mode
Runs the evolutionary algorithm to discover profitable strategies.

### Backtest Mode
Tests evolved strategies against historical data using fork testing.

### Live Mode
Paper trades in real-time using evolved strategies (no real funds).

## Evolutionary Algorithm

### 1. Population Initialization
- 20 agents with random strategy genes
- Diverse initial strategies

### 2. Fitness Evaluation
- Test each agent on historical opportunities
- Fitness = profit Ã— success_rate

### 3. Selection
- Tournament selection with size 4
- Elite retention of top 20%

### 4. Crossover
- 80% chance of breeding
- Multiple crossover methods (uniform, weighted, blend)

### 5. Mutation
- 5% mutation rate
- Conservative mutations prefer small changes
- Occasional diversity injection

### 6. Generation Loop
- Repeat until convergence or generation limit

## Key Innovations

### Collective Intelligence
Multiple agents vote on opportunities, similar to a school of fish making decisions.

### Species Management
Agents are organized into species based on genetic similarity, maintaining diversity.

### Adaptive Evolution
Mutation rates and strategies adapt based on market conditions.

### Teacher-Student Learning
Successful strategies learn to explain their decisions for debugging and improvement.
